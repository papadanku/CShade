        Reinhard-Squared

        This has some nice properties that improve on basic Reinhard.  Firstly, it has a "toe"--that nice,
        parabolic upswing that enhances contrast and color saturation in darks.  Secondly, it has a long
        shoulder giving greater detail in highlights and taking longer to desaturate.  It's invertible, scales
        to HDR displays, and is easy to control.

        The default constant of 0.25 was chosen for two reasons.  It maps closely to the effect of Reinhard
        with a constant of 1.0.  And with a constant of 0.25, there is an inflection point at 0.25 where the
        curve touches the line y=x and then begins the shoulder.

        Note:  If you are currently using ACES and you pre-scale by 0.6, then k=0.30 looks nice as an alternative
        without any other adjustments.
